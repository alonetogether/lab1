	<p>Sophomore Cognitive Science, Human Computer Interaction Major at UC San Diego.

Understanding culture, context, and behavior to impact people.

I'm a firm believer in the potentiality of humanistic design in making sense of our messy reality. Knowing that technology alone is not a panacea to our problems, I prioritize the understanding of the human before the interface in my work.

Dedicated to the bootstrapped design movement here at UC San Diego. Zealous advocate of collaboration across disciplines and design-doing beyond design thinking.
